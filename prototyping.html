    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p> A group of UC Berkeley students set to tackle the problem of how to improve and maintain mental health among students at the university. A three-month long open-ended exploration composed of literary research, multiple user interviews, and usability testing resulted in the development of a digital prototype for an appointment booking app for stress relieving activities. </p>
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Develop an intuitive, user-friendly, and practical prototype by learning how users will naturally interact with the app.</p>
    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <h3>Iteration 1:</h3>

  <p>During the early stages of the design, we had two initial concepts that we wanted to test out. I developed sketches of each concept on poster paper and highlighted the key features and benefits. These sketches were shared with the class and feedback was gathered from fellow classmates. </p>

    <p>After narrowing down the concepts, I decided to develop a low-fidelity paper prototype in order to quickly test the product idea and illustrate the user interactions. I created an iPhone using cardboard and sketched the different screens of the app on paper. <strong>I tested the prototype with users by manually switching the screens based on what the user selected.</strong> I observed how the users interacted with the prototype and gathered feedback during the walkthroughs. </p>

    <h3>Iteration 3:</h3>

    <p>Based off of feedback we received during Iteration 1, I worked with one other teammate to develop a digital layout of the app using Adobe Illustrator. </p>

    <h3>Final Prototype:</h3>
    <img src="/prototype5.png" src="prototype5">
    <p>In order to demonstrate the app flow, we used Figma to develop our final prototype. <strong>The text information was now interactive, giving users a more realistic experience of the product. </strong></p>
    <h2>Output:</h2>

    <p>The final design concept was shared at the 2017 Jacobs Winter Design Showcase at UC Berkeley. </p>

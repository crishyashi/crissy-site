    <h1>USER INTERVIEWS</h1>

  <!--Main Content-->
  <section class="content container">
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>Conducted user interviews to discover gaps in the current breastfeeding education provided in Contra Costa County and to explore ideas for improvement.</p>
    <h2>Challenge:</h2>
    <p>Rates of mothers choosing to feed breastmilk only had become stagnant and was not increasing.</p>
    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p>Get at the root of “Why are mothers choosing to not only feed breastmilk?”</p>
    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <h3>Questionnaire Design</h3>
    <p>Before creating the questionnaire, I met with the Breastfeeding Education Task Force which consisted of OB/GYNs, health educators, and the Pediatric Medical Director to understand and clarify the goals of the interviews. With the objectives in mind, <strong>I developed 11 questions to delve deeper into the viewpoints and experiences mothers had around breastfeeding.</strong></p>
    <h3>Recruitment</h3>
    <p>On every Tuesday and Thursday for the duration of one month, the Pediatric Medical Director identified mothers at Contra Costa Regional Medical Center who had just given birth to participate in the user interviews. Mothers who had complications or other difficulties that would not allow them to participate were not included. Interpreters were available for non-English speakers.</p>
    <p><strong>Within one month, I completed 23 interviews.</strong></p>
    <h2>Analysis:</h2>
    <p>While in the hospital, 87% of mothers were feeding their newborns breastmilk only.  When asked “How are you planning to feed your baby after you leave the hospital:</p>
    <p class="tab">- 83% indicated breastmilk only</p>
    <p class="tab">- 13% indicated breastmilk and formula</p>
    <p class="tab">- 4% indicated formula only</p>
    <p>I dug deeper by asking mothers to explain in detail why they have made this choice. From listening to their stories, I discovered that returning to work was the biggest reason why mothers were choosing to feed breastmilk and formula.</p>
    <p class="tab">“I breastfeed my baby right now because it’s the best…I know that. But I have to go to work so what can you do you know?"</p>
    <p>Ultimately through our conversations, I gathered that work was not the real issue, but instead the reason why mothers were deciding to feed formula and breastmilk was because of limited education and access to breast pumps. </p>
    <p class="tab">“I never heard of pumping. If it is not expensive then of course I would rather do that.”</p>
    <p class="tab">“They told us we can get a pump at WIC but I don’t have time to go there to get one. We have never been there. I don’t know if they will even give us one.”</p>
    <p class="tab">“I don’t know how to do it and I don’t feel confident I can do it on my own.”</p>
    <p><strong>This finding revealed that there was a need for pumping education and better access to breast pumps.</strong> </p>
    <h2>Output:</h2>
    <p>I developed a report for the Perinatal Care Team at Contra Costa Regional Medical Center.</p>
    <p>Steps were taken to ensure that free breast pumps would be available at the hospital and that pumping education would be added to the breastfeeding education materials. </p>
    <h2>Impact:</h2>
    <p>These insights helped improve the breastfeeding education provided at the hospital. With more information on pumping along with easy access to breast pumps, mothers now have less barriers to feeding their babies breastmilk. This will ultimately lead to better health for their babies.</p>

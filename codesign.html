    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>Organized and facilitated a co-design session where patients and staff came together to learn about an opportunity area and partner to come up with solutions.</p>
    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p>Gather experiences and more information from mothers on how the client can improve services received during the first trimester in Contra Costa County.</p>
    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <p>In order to plan the activities for the co-design session, I needed a clear understanding of the journey map of a patient during their first trimester in Contra Costa County. <strong>I reached out to and met with doctors from the health centers and the hospital to learn about the encounters that a patient would have with the client’s services during their first trimester.</strong> I determined the three touchpoints in the Journey Map activity would include:</p>
    <p class="tab">- First Pregnancy Test</p>
    <p class="tab">- First Doctor's Appointment</p>
    <p class="tab">- First Education Visit</p>
    <h3>Recruitment</h3>
    <p>To recruit participants, I leveraged the client’s connections to partner with local health centers with parenting groups. My plan was to conduct the co-design session after a regularly scheduled parenting group meeting in order to make travel easier for participants. I was able to recruit 5 participants who were in their third trimester of pregnancy.</p>

    <p><strong>The co-design session consisted of 5 patients and 2 staff members.</strong>  As the facilitator, I enthusiastically guided participants through the activities while also listening deeply to their stories. </p>
    <h4 class="tab">Journey Map</h4>
    <p class="tab">During the Journey Map activity, patients were asked to record on post-its, 1-2 experiences (positive or negative) for each of the touch points. As patients shared their experiences with the group, staff members were asked to listen and record on post-it’s the things they were hearing.</p>
    <p class="tab">Although participants mainly shared positive experiences, by asking the right questions, I was able to get patients to open up about some difficulties they have had.</p>
    <h4 class="tab">Opportunities for Improvement</h4>
    <p class="tab">For this activity, I collected the post-it’s from the staff and grouped similar ones together. I read the themes out loud and clarified with patients to make sure nothing was missed. Patients were then asked to vote on the top two opportunities they would like staff to focus on improving.</p>
    <h4 class="tab">How Might We</h4>
    <p class="tab">Using the top voted opportunity for improvement, participants came up with one “How might we” statement. Patients then shared potential solutions to the group</p>
    <h2>Analysis:</h2>
    <h3>What Worked Well</h3>
    <p class="tab"><strong>Communication</strong> – Participants were comfortable and open to sharing</p>
    <p class="tab"><strong>Sitting during activities</strong> – In a standard co-design session, I would have had participants stand to keep their energy levels high. Since this group consisted of pregnant women in their third trimester, I opted for a more relaxed session.</p>
    <p class="tab"><strong>Timing</strong> – The time for the co-design session did not feel long and participants stayed engaged.</p>
    <p class="tab"><strong>Logistics</strong> – Food, room setup, gift cards </p>
    <h3>Needs Improvement</h3>
    <p class="tab"><strong>More time</strong> – Based on participant availability, we only had an hour and a half to hold the session so we were not able to complete all the activities. </p>
    <p class="tab"><strong>Rewording of “First Pregnancy Test”</strong> – Some patients shared experiences about their first pregnancy test with using an over the counter pregnancy test instead of their first pregnancy test with the doctor. </p>
    <p class="tab"><strong>Recruit a more diverse group</strong> – All the participants were from West County Health Center perinatal groups. Since these women are already in a support group, their experiences tend to be more positive compared to women not in a support group. </p>
    <h2>Output:</h2>
    <p>A better plan for continuity of care was established and adopted by Contra Costa healthcare staff
    </p>
    <h2>Impact:</h2>
    <p>This co-design improved prenatal services delivered by Contra Costa County. With better continuity of care, mothers will have healthier pregnancies. </p>

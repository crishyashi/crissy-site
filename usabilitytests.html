  	<h2>Overview:</h2>
  	<p>Planned and conducted usability tests of the client’s symptom tracking app for Lyme disease.</p>
  	<h2>Challenge:</h2>
  	<p>To be able to meet the needs of their targeted customer segment, Clymb Health asked for user-centered recommendations to shape the development of a new version of their symptom tracking app.</p>
  	<h2>Goals:</h2>
  	<p>Engage and empathize with real target users to identify potential usability concerns in the new designs in order to improve the efficiency, productivity, and end-user satisfaction of the symptom tracking app.</p>
  	<h2>Process:</h2>
  	<p><strong>The usability tests were conducted during the months of April and May 2018 with people who had chronic symptoms.</strong> The objective was to find usability flaws in the new designs of the symptom tracking app and to compare the time taken to record symptoms on the new app to the results from the old version of the app.</p>
  	<h3>Experiment Design</h3>
  	<p>Working with a team of three UC Berkeley students, we developed an experiment with three tasks to:<p>
  		<p class="tab">1. Find out whether users could map symptom severity scale (0 - 4) to the concept of symptom severity in their own minds.</p>
  		<p class="tab">2. Find out what users understand about progress from looking at mockups of charts representing their health.</p>
  		<p class="tab">3. Find out if users understand how information is organized in the app.</p>
  	<p>During the experiment, our team checked for task completion times while taking note of critical errors.</p>
  	<h3>Recruitment</h3>
  	<p>Given the time frame of the project and the limited available Lyme patient population, we decided to recruit users who had chronic conditions. We developed screening questions and reached out to people on Facebook groups. <strong>I personally visited and conducted usability tests with three participants.</strong></p>
  	<h3>Test Environment</h3>
  	<p>The tests were conducted on an iPhone 6S on the Marvel App with prototypes of new designs of the multi-platform web-app. The functionalities were limited as we used images instead of a live web-app. The environment was of the participant’s choice as we wanted to ensure they were comfortable and at ease while taking the test.</p>
  	<h2>Analysis:</h2>
  	<h3>Top Things Learned</h3>
  	<p class="tab">1. <strong>Task 1 completion rates were low.</strong> Participants were expected to press the “Save to Timeline” button in order to save the symptom severity data on the app. 2 out of 3 participants failed to press the button when asked if they thought the task was complete.</p>
  	<p class="tab">2. <strong>Participants like the way information about their health is represented.</strong> It gives them great insight into their health and they especially liked the score that represented their symptom severities.</p>
  	<p class="tab">3. <strong>Everyone was able to reach the calendar view</strong> to jump to a much earlier date in Task 3. </p>
  	<h2>Output:</h2>
  	<p>Developed recommendations based off of the results from the usability tests and included them in a report to the client.</p>
    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <p class="tab">1. Float the "Save to Timeline" button on the screen in order to make it continuously visible to the user.</p>
    <p class="tab">2.Create an autosave feature to save information as it is tapped.</p>
    <p class="tab">3. Change the wording of the button to make it more intuitive to save information.</p>
  	<h2>Impact:</h2>
  	<p>The results from the usability tests will be used to shape the redesign of the Clymb Health app. Lyme patients will be able to have improved care management by being able to record their health information on a daily basis in order to better understand their condition.</p>
